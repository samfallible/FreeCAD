This macro creates a "topologically safe" parametric cuboid. It was made using the macro recorder. It is designed to be used from the FreeCAD start page. The resulting cuboid is made using a padded sketch with absolute references to the body origin. It's parameters are found in the spreadsheet "var". The default parameters are set to 1 in by conversion of 25.4mm/in.
