This macro creates a "topologically safe" parametric cuboid. It was made using the macro recorder, and designed to be used from the FreeCAD start page. The resulting cuboid is made from a padded sketch with constraints only referencing the body origin. Parameters are in the spreadsheet "var". The default parameters are set to 1in by conversion of 25.4mm/in.
